## 0.1.0 (2024-10-04)
- Initial release with support for the Composite ML-KEM / ML-DSA draft standards.
- The ML-DSA implementation used is without context and uses the [ipd OIDs](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md) to support interoperability testing with `oqs-provider`.
- A version with context (and using the new OIDs) will be published immediately after this release.
